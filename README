smalle is a very small library to demonstrate compiling,
installing and linking a shared library. The library has one API and
one callback. The callback is defined in the unit test in smalle-test
directory.

Distribution Structure
======================
smalle/
The shared library code, header and Makefile is in this directory.

smalle-test/
The unit test code that links dynamically with libsmalle is in this directory.


Build Instructions

Compiling the library
---------------------
1. 
$ cd smalle
$ make all
$ sudo make install
This installs the shared library using ldconfig. 

2.
Add the path to the library (/usr/local/lib) in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var

3.
To clean up:
$ make clean

Compiling the test program
